# Loan Default Risk Classifier 

  
## Abstract 

  The Loan Default Risk Classifier is a machine learning-based framework developed to predict the likelihood of loan default using structured borrower and loan data. As the demand for data-driven credit risk assessment grows within financial institutions, this project offers an end-to-end, interpretable, and scalable solution that leverages statistical learning techniques for enhanced decision-making. This work is grounded in fundamental concepts of applied machine learning, domain-specific feature engineering, and model evaluation under class imbalance. 

   

## 1. Introduction 

  Accurate assessment of loan default risk is critical to the operational efficiency of banks and financial institutions. Traditional credit scoring systems often rely on rigid heuristics and outdated financial history, which fail to capture nuanced borrower behavior or adapt to evolving economic conditions. This project introduces a robust classification pipeline capable of learning from historical data and generalizing to unseen cases, thereby minimizing default exposure while maximizing portfolio performance. 

  

  
## 2. Objective 

  To develop and evaluate supervised learning models that can: 

  
- Predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default 

- Identify the most influential features affecting default risk 

- Provide probabilistic outputs for risk-based segmentation 

  

## 3. Dataset 

The dataset comprises borrower-level records that typically include: 

- Demographics (age, marital status, number of dependents) 

- Financial data (income, debt-to-income ratio, credit history length) 

- Loan characteristics (amount requested, purpose, interest rate, tenure) 

- Behavioral and historical repayment features (if available) 

  

The dataset is located in the `supporting_files.zip`.
  

## 4. Methodology 

### 4.1 Data Preprocessing 

- Handling missing values using domain-informed imputation strategies 

- Encoding categorical variables (label encoding and one-hot encoding) 

- Normalizing continuous features to a standard scale 

- Outlier detection and removal using IQR and z-score methods 

### 4.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

- Univariate and bivariate distributions 

- Correlation matrices 

- Class distribution assessment (imbalance analysis)  

### 4.3 Feature Engineering 

- Debt ratio, employment length buckets, credit utilization rate 

- Interaction features and polynomial transformations (optional) 

### 4.4 Modeling Algorithms 

- Logistic Regression (baseline) 

- Random Forest Classifier 

- XGBoost / Gradient Boosting Machines 

- (Optional) Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks for comparison 

### 4.5 Evaluation Metrics 

- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score 

- Confusion Matrix 

- ROC Curve and AUC 

- Precision-Recall Curve for imbalanced dataset evaluation

Usage 

## To reproduce or extend the work presented in this repository: 

Open the notebook Loan_Default_Risk_Classifier_UsmanGhani.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code with the appropriate Python environment activated. 

Execute each code cell sequentially to observe the complete workflow, including: 

### Data preprocessing 

### Exploratory data analysis (EDA) 

### Model training and evaluation 

Users are encouraged to modify feature engineering steps, hyperparameters, and model configurations to experiment with alternative strategies or improve performance. 

 
## Results & Observations 

Among the models evaluated, XGBoost consistently outperformed others in terms of ROC-AUC and F1-score, reflecting its robustness in handling imbalanced classification problems. 

The most influential features in predicting loan default risk were: 

### Debt-to-Income Ratio 

### Previous Delinquencies 

### Income Range 

These features exhibited strong discriminatory power in distinguishing defaulters from non-defaulters. 

While the current version is designed as an analytical notebook, the model architecture and data preprocessing pipeline are structured to facilitate easy extension for deployment in production environments. 

 
## Limitations 

While this study offers a practical approach to default risk prediction, certain limitations remain: 

### Dataset Preprocessing: The dataset used was already preprocessed; access to raw transactional and behavioral data would enable the development of more sophisticated temporal or deep learning models. 

### Model Explainability: Techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME for interpretability were not integrated into the current pipeline but are strongly recommended for future enhancements. 

### Deployment Scope: Real-time prediction serving through an API or web-based frontend is outside the scope of this notebook but can be implemented using tools such as Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit.
