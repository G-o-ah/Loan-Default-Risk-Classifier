# Loan Default Risk Classifier 

  
## Abstract 

  The Loan Default Risk Classifier is a machine learning-based framework developed to predict the likelihood of loan default using structured borrower and loan data. As the demand for data-driven credit risk assessment grows within financial institutions, this project offers an end-to-end, interpretable, and scalable solution that leverages statistical learning techniques for enhanced decision-making. This work is grounded in fundamental concepts of applied machine learning, domain-specific feature engineering, and model evaluation under class imbalance. 

   

## 1. Introduction 

  Accurate assessment of loan default risk is critical to the operational efficiency of banks and financial institutions. Traditional credit scoring systems often rely on rigid heuristics and outdated financial history, which fail to capture nuanced borrower behavior or adapt to evolving economic conditions. This project introduces a robust classification pipeline capable of learning from historical data and generalizing to unseen cases, thereby minimizing default exposure while maximizing portfolio performance. 

  

  
## 2. Objective 

  To develop and evaluate supervised learning models that can: 

  
- Predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default 

- Identify the most influential features affecting default risk 

- Provide probabilistic outputs for risk-based segmentation 

  

## 3. Dataset 

The dataset comprises borrower-level records that typically include: 

- Demographics (age, marital status, number of dependents) 

- Financial data (income, debt-to-income ratio, credit history length) 

- Loan characteristics (amount requested, purpose, interest rate, tenure) 

- Behavioral and historical repayment features (if available) 

  

The dataset is located in the `supporting_files.zip`.
  

## 4. Methodology 

### 4.1 Data Preprocessing 

- Handling missing values using domain-informed imputation strategies 

- Encoding categorical variables (label encoding and one-hot encoding) 

- Normalizing continuous features to a standard scale 

- Outlier detection and removal using IQR and z-score methods 

### 4.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

- Univariate and bivariate distributions 

- Correlation matrices 

- Class distribution assessment (imbalance analysis)  

### 4.3 Feature Engineering 

- Debt ratio, employment length buckets, credit utilization rate 

- Interaction features and polynomial transformations (optional) 

### 4.4 Modeling Algorithms 

- Logistic Regression (baseline) 

- Random Forest Classifier 

- XGBoost / Gradient Boosting Machines 

- (Optional) Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks for comparison 

### 4.5 Evaluation Metrics 

- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score 

- Confusion Matrix 

- ROC Curve and AUC 

- Precision-Recall Curve for imbalanced dataset evaluation
